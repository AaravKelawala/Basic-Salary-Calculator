#I made this to calculate a basic salary estimate to help people gauge how much an average job pays annually, based off of experience in years.
#This is simply for a rough estimate and actual annual pay and will vary job to job.
#Once running the program, input a number representing work experience in years then click enter, the result is how much you will be paid for one year.
#I used the Salary dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression and python to code this.
